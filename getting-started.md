## Goerli Nethermind (Execution Client)

Welcome to your Merged Goerli/Prater Nethermind Execution Layer Client

There are now two RPC APIs in Execution Clients:

1. Querying API `http://goerli-nethermind.dappnode:8545`. Use this endpoint to query transactions on your node and connect to it with your web3 wallet.
2. Engine API `http://goerli-nethermind.dappnode:8551`. Use this endpoint to connect your Beacon Chain (Consensus Layer) client.

- If your Execution Client is not connected to a Consensus Layer client, you won't be able to keep it synced, nor use it to query the blockchain, nor will you be able to connect your wallet to it!
- All Staking Management has a new home in the Comprehensive [StakersUI](http://my.dappnode/#/stakers/prater)

If you have enabled the Nethermind UI: You can access by clicking [Nethermind UI](http://goerli-nethermind.dappnode:8551/healthchecks-ui) Or the UI link below.
If you want to enable it you can do it if you go to config section and enable the below option.
